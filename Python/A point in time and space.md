# 📚 Understanding Big O Notation — A Beginner’s Guide for Data Science Students

When we write code, we want it to be **not just correct**, but also **efficient**. Imagine an app that takes forever to load just because of poorly written logic. That’s where **Big O Notation** helps us — it lets us measure and compare how fast (or slow) our code runs as the input gets bigger.

## ✅ What is Big O Notation?

**Big O** describes the **worst-case performance** of an algorithm in terms of:

- ⏱️ **Time Complexity** – How long does the algorithm take to run?
- 🧠 **Space Complexity** – How much memory does it use?

It focuses on **growth patterns**, not exact timings.

## 📈 Visual Guide to Time Complexities

This chart shows how different algorithms scale as the number of elements (`n`) increases. The green areas are efficient; red areas are slow and expensive.

## 🔢 Common Time Complexities (With Python Examples)

| Notation     | Name           | What It Means                               | Example in Python                    |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **O(1)**     | Constant Time  | Same time no matter the input size           | `my_list[0]` (accessing an index)    |
| **O(log n)** | Logarithmic    | Gets faster as it divides input              | Binary search on a sorted list       |
| **O(n)**     | Linear         | Time grows directly with input size          | Looping through a list               |
| **O(n log n)**| Linearithmic  | Efficient sorting                            | `sorted(my_list)`                    |
| **O(n²)**    | Quadratic      | Nested loops                                 | Bubble sort                          |
| **O(2ⁿ)**    | Exponential    | Recursion (Fibonacci)                        | `fib(n)` with no memoization         |
